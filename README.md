# Card Automation Project

The Card Automation Project is a student council initiative aimed at automating the creation of cards based on a template. The program reads a CSV file containing the sender, receiver, and message information, and automatically generates cards by populating the template with the provided data. This automation saves time and effort by eliminating the need for manual creation of individual cards.

## General Information

The Card Automation Project simplifies the process of creating cards for various purposes such as greetings, invitations, or special announcements. Instead of manually designing each card, the program takes input from a CSV file that includes sender, receiver, and message details. It then applies this information to a predefined card template, generating personalized cards efficiently.
